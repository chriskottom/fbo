<DESC><p>The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to stop the infiltration of river water into the dewatering pits in the north downstream approach walls at both Eisenhower and Snell Locks in Massena, New York.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> Each lock has a dewatering pit that is equipped with pumps which maintain general drainage of the lock facility and are also used to remove water from the lock chamber below low pool elevation to facilitate maintenance work. </span>At each lock, the pumps are located in recesses in the concrete approach wall approximately 15 feet below the top of the wall and pump water from pits located below the floors of these recesses. Water infiltration through horizontal joints/seams in the concrete near the bottoms of the pump recesses requires excessive pumping to keep the dewatering pits dry. Although the Contractor may choose its own methods, the SLSDC feels the objective may best be accomplished by injecting sealant material into drilled holes that intersect the water infiltration paths. <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Plans are to award the work in September 2013, dependent upon the availability of funds. Quotes must be valid for sixty (60) days to allow for a later award, if necessary. The work is to be completed within sixty (60) days of the award. The RFP will be released on or about August 9, 2013, with a response date of approximately September 11, 2013. The cost range is between </span>$25,000 and $100,000.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY<br />The purpose of this notice is for the Government to obtain most current information regarding firms interested in and capable of performing the subject project. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this acquisition lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, is conducting this market research to identify businesses which have the capability to execute the following proposed project:</p>
<p>Scope: Demolish from 2 to 8 Army Family Housing buildings, including foundations and all associated site work, at Fort Greely, Alaska. Fort Greely is located along the Richardson Highway, approximately 100 miles south of Fairbanks Alaska. Fort Greely is near Delta Junction, Alaska which as limited housing and support facilities. The eight buildings are all located in the same general area along Third Street in the Cantonment area of Fort Greely. Each building is a townhouse style eight-plex with approximate 15,000 square footage per building. The buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are spread footing, concrete foundations with wood framing. Six of the buildings have attached garage additions that will also be removed. Hazardous surveys have been conducted, and all the buildings have extensive asbestos, which must be removed before final demolition. Various site work around the buildings will be removed including parking lots, Headbolt outlets, stoops, electrical, utilidors, and sidewalks. The utilidors will be demolished back to the mainlines and are assumed to contain asbestos covered piping. The foundation holes will be filled with classified fill and the area will be graded, receive topsoil and seeded. There will be a 58% diversion goal from landfills for all non-hazardous construction debris. The base landfill will be available for disposal of asbestos material and other Construction waste. The area is next to existing occupied housing areas, so noise, safety, dust, etc. are important to manage on this project.</p>
<p>The construction period is estimated to be approximately 365 days with a notice to proceed anticipated in January 2014. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238910, Site Preparation Contractors, and the related small business size standard is $14.0 Million. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be $1.5-$2.5 Million.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR QUALIFIED PRIME CONTRACTOR FIRMS ONLY. All interested small business firms are encouraged to respond to this notice by October 22, 2013. Please submit all requested documentation listed below to: US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, ATTN: CEPOA-SP- (Suprenant), PO Box 6898, JBER, AK 99506-0898 or via email to michael.d.suprenant@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>Interested small business firms should submit a capabilities package (not exceeding 3 pages) demonstrating the ability to perform work listed above. Packages should include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Business name, address and business size under NAICS 238910</p>
<p>(2) Identify small business type, if applicable (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), WOSB, etc)</p>
<p>(3) Demonstration of the firm's experience as a prime contractor on projects of similar size, type and complexity<br />within the past five years.</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE YOUR FIRM'S EXPERIENCE WITH DEMOLITION AND/OR WITH ASBESTOS ABATEMENT. List actual projects completed to include project title and location, a brief description of the project to include dollar amount of the project and work that was self-performed. Responsible sources demonstrating relevant experience and the capabilities to perform the work will be considered. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. Please feel free to use the FBO site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.
<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER N00164-13-C-JS13.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, intends to modify the existing firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract N00164-13-C-JS13, awarded to SUNAIR ELECTRONICS, 200 S. ANDREWS AVE. #7B, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33312, CAGE 12338, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for the procurement of additional hardware for the AN/TSQ-269 Mobile Tactical Air Operations Module (MTAOM) Systems. The total maximum dollar value of $1,044,727.20 will increase by an estimated $650,000.00 as a result of this modification. The required supplies are as follows:</p>
<p>CLIN 0015 - P/N 8120001052 - CU-9150 ANTENNA COUPLER - QTY 30 EACH <br />CLIN 0016 - P/N 8092500096 - CONTROL CABLE ASSEMBLY - QTY 30 EACH<br />CLIN 0017 - P/N 0588680001 - CONTROL CABLE - QTY 3000 FEET<br />CLIN 0018 - CU-9150 Extended Warranty - QTY 30 EACH</p>
<p>Delivery terms are 180 days after effective date of order with F.O.B: Origin, Inspection and Acceptance: Destination.</p>
<p>This contract action will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The basis for restricting competition is that Sunair is the original equipment manufacturer and is not willing to sell the data rights for the complex high frequency data capable radio assemblies. Procurement from any other source would result in an unacceptable high risk to the government and would jeopardize timely delivery of a satisfactory end product, currently estimated at sixteen months delay and the safety of troops on the ground in-theatre. Specifications, plans or drawings relating to the procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, does not currently have an approved technical data package for this item; please do not submit requests. The point of contact for this action is Ms. Diane Bright, telephone 812-854-2938, e-mail: diane.bright@navy.mil (preferred method). Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

<div><br />RE: &nbsp;Status of payments for utility service/energy supply under the current Fiscal &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Year 2014 lapse in funding</div>
<div><br />As you may be aware, GSA and other Federal agencies have not received an annual appropriation for Fiscal Year 2014. &nbsp;In spite of that, utility services for Federal buildings are considered &ldquo;excepted activities&rdquo; under a lapse in appropriations which allows an agency to incur an obligation for utility services/energy supply in the absence of appropriations. &nbsp;Therefore, utilities/energy suppliers are to continue to provide service/supply under existing contracts to Federal buildings during a lapse in appropriations. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />For GSA, utilities/energy suppliers will be paid for service/supply delivered with a meter read end date of September 30, 2013 or sooner in accordance with the appropriate due date for the payment of those bills. &nbsp;For utility service/energy supply bills with a meter read end date on October 1, 2013 or later, GSA will process payments as soon as appropriations covering all or a portion of Fiscal Year 2014 are received. &nbsp;</div>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the <br />Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF23356521A is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses under NAICS Code 541620 with size standard not exceeding 7 million dollars. <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 requires all labor and expertise to conduct research into testing for the evaluation of an advanced oxidation alternative to the current biological groundwater containment treatment system and a cost effective in-situ smoldering thermal treatment system technology to destroy contaminants in place. <br>   <br> Specific tasks are listed below:  <br>  <br> CLIN 0001: Pilot Remediation Technologies to be evaluated at the Zephyr site for Environmental Processes Remediation. (Evaluating a mobile advanced oxidation system that can be connected to the current plumbing on-site.)  <br>  <br> Evaluate mobile advanced oxidation process (AOP) unit for pilot testing at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI capable of replacing current biological treatment system.  The unit must be multi-use technology with the specific combination of AOP/cavitation/electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents.  The unit must be capable of a flow through range of 400-3400 gallons per minute. The unit should be mobile, self-powered with no reject or waste stream outside the return or effluent stream.  The unit should be capable of limited to no off-gas of breakdown constituents including ozone.  The unit should be capable of online operation within 24-48 hours of mobilization to the site. The unit must be capable of degrading both chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons including both gasoline and fuel oil #1 from site groundwater. Evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment by an accredited laboratory using EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs), EPA SW 846 Method 6020 metals analysis, Total dissolved solids (TDS), and Dissolved Oxygen. The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the pilot scale evaluation. The contractor must supply the mobile oxidation treatment system to include all transportation costs, all labor and material to connect to the current system, operator labor, sample labor, sample vials and all analytical cost. The contractor must also return the onsite system to its previous operational condition/state after evaluation. No change orders that include additional cost to this evaluation/SOW will be accepted. Contractor must coordinate site treatment operation with both ERDC and MDEQ so the proper oversight can be scheduled and conducted. (Must be a complete turnaround package.)  <br>  <br> The unit will treat the contaminated groundwater. ERDC will observe the system operation and make sure that the contractor takes samples taken from both inlet and outlet of the system labeled, cataloged properly on a chain of custody form then shipped in appropriate container(s) to an approved laboratory for analysis. The sampling, cataloging, chain of custody, etc. criteria are specifically stated within each EPA Methods listed. <br>  <br> The contaminants in the groundwater to be treated by the mobile treatment unit are Oil Range Organics (ORO), Diesel Range Organics (DRO), and Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) compounds.  The contaminant concentrations pumped from the recovery wells/system may range from hundreds of parts per billion to thousands of parts per billion of total BTEX.  The actual contaminant concentrations are unknown and believed to exist in mostly free phase but non-aqueous phase liquids may be present.   <br> There are no documents or background reports available and no previous pilot studies have been conducted on site. No raw water or influent analytical data results are available. There are no site maps, piping, system schematics, or Process & Instrument Diagram (P&ID) diagrams available of the current treatment system.  <br>  <br> The specific combination of AOP treatments must include cavitation and electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents. The pilot study should be conducted within a sufficient time frame to determine whether this system is appropriate for the site and should meet MDEQ requirements for discharge and will be evaluated for cost per gallon treated and efficiency. The duration of the mobile unit test should be less than 1 week. All electrical power must provided by the mobile unit. A site walk is not planned. The award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0001 $__________ <br>  <br> CLIN 0002: Bench scale testing of a self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment technology using a site soil sample containing free product (gasoline and fuel oil #1) from the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI. The test will have to demonstrate exothermic oxidation of the target contaminants in the sample tested under a process that is self-sustaining without continuous external energy input after initial ignition. The test should demonstrate engineering control of the self-sustaining smoldering process and also the ability to terminate the process under controlled measures.  The contractor's offer must demonstrate that the testing apparatus and supporting infrastructure as well as the expertise to perform the testing has been secured.  Bench scale evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment equivalent to EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs). The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the bench scale testing. <br>  <br> Self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment uses smoldering combustion to destroy contaminants.  The goal of the self sustained smoldering bench test is to determine if this treatment technology is applicable to this site. The most concentrated contaminants remaining in the subsurface are believed to be in either sand, silt and silty sand at a depth between 25 - 35 ft below ground surface (bgs). The contaminants could be shallower or deeper. The volume of contaminants are assumed over 1,000,000 gallons in the form of DRO, GRO, ORO in concentrations range from non detect to over 100,000,000 ug/kg. The distribution of free phase and non-aqueous phase liquids is not known. There is no map available Soil contaminants sample cores must be extracted by drilling only no excavator can be used. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0002 $______________ <br>  <br> Option CLIN 0003: Successful treatment of bench-scale smoldering testing will lead to a pilot scale evaluation at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI if funds are available.  <br>  <br> There is no in-situ designed approach at this time, therefore the Pilot treatment is undefined. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0003 $_______________ <br>  <br> Parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, on the items quoted including, but not limited to, technical brochures, specification sheets indicating technical ability, pictures, etc. sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.   <br>  <br> Price shall include any shipping, FOB Destination.  <br>  <br> FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l.	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 
5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE 

a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation. 
b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII. 
c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks. 

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost. 

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE. 

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are: 

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive; 

(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or 

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase. 

(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then; 

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and 

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.

(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation. 

6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH 

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 

(2) Description of the event, including: 
(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; 
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 
 Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
 (1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING 

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

9. TRAINING 

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 

(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems; 
(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training; 
(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and 
(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]                                                 


** A  Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is required.  A copy of the signed BAA must be submitted to the Privacy Office. (Attachment 4)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF23356521A is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is for full and open competition under NAICS Code 541620.  <br>    <br>  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 requires all labor and expertise to conduct research into testing for the evaluation of an advanced oxidation alternative to the current biological groundwater containment treatment system and a cost effective in-situ smoldering thermal treatment system technology to destroy contaminants in place.  <br>     <br>  Specific tasks are listed below:   <br>    <br>  CLIN 0001: Pilot Remediation Technologies to be evaluated at the Zephyr site for Environmental Processes Remediation. (Evaluating a mobile advanced oxidation system that can be connected to the current plumbing on-site.)   <br>    <br>  Evaluate mobile advanced oxidation process (AOP) unit for pilot testing at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI capable of replacing current biological treatment system.  The unit must be multi-use technology with the specific combination of AOP/cavitation/electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents.  The unit must be capable of a flow through range of 400-3400 gallons per minute. The unit should be mobile, self-powered with no reject or waste stream outside the return or effluent stream.  The unit should be capable of limited to no off-gas of breakdown constituents including ozone.  The unit should be capable of online operation within 24-48 hours of mobilization to the site. The unit must be capable of degrading both chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons including both gasoline and fuel oil #1 from site groundwater. Evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment by an accredited laboratory using EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs), EPA SW 846 Method 6020 metals analysis, Total dissolved solids (TDS), and Dissolved Oxygen. The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the pilot scale evaluation. The contractor must supply the mobile oxidation treatment system to include all transportation costs, all labor and material to connect to the current system, operator labor, sample labor, sample vials and all analytical cost. The contractor must also return the onsite system to its previous operational condition/state after evaluation. No change orders that include additional cost to this evaluation/SOW will be accepted. Contractor must coordinate site treatment operation with both ERDC and MDEQ so the proper oversight can be scheduled and conducted. (Must be a complete turnaround package.)   <br>    <br>  The unit will treat the contaminated groundwater. ERDC will observe the system operation and make sure that the contractor takes samples taken from both inlet and outlet of the system labeled, cataloged properly on a chain of custody form then shipped in appropriate container(s) to an approved laboratory for analysis. The sampling, cataloging, chain of custody, etc. criteria are specifically stated within each EPA Methods listed.  <br>    <br>  The contaminants in the groundwater to be treated by the mobile treatment unit are Oil Range Organics (ORO), Diesel Range Organics (DRO), and Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) compounds.  The contaminant concentrations pumped from the recovery wells/system may range from hundreds of parts per billion to thousands of parts per billion of total BTEX.  The actual contaminant concentrations are unknown and believed to exist in mostly free phase but non-aqueous phase liquids may be present.    <br>  There are no documents or background reports available and no previous pilot studies have been conducted on site. No raw water or influent analytical data results are available. There are no site maps, piping, system schematics, or Process & Instrument Diagram (P&ID) diagrams available of the current treatment system.   <br>    <br>  The specific combination of AOP treatments must include cavitation and electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents. The pilot study should be conducted within a sufficient time frame to determine whether this system is appropriate for the site and should meet MDEQ requirements for discharge and will be evaluated for cost per gallon treated and efficiency. The duration of the mobile unit test should be less than 1 week. All electrical power must provided by the mobile unit. A site walk is not planned. The award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0001 $__________  <br>    <br>  CLIN 0002: Bench scale testing of a self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment technology using a site soil sample containing free product (gasoline and fuel oil #1) from the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI. The test will have to demonstrate exothermic oxidation of the target contaminants in the sample tested under a process that is self-sustaining without continuous external energy input after initial ignition. The test should demonstrate engineering control of the self-sustaining smoldering process and also the ability to terminate the process under controlled measures.  The contractor's offer must demonstrate that the testing apparatus and supporting infrastructure as well as the expertise to perform the testing has been secured.  Bench scale evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment equivalent to EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs). The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the bench scale testing.  <br>    <br>  Self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment uses smoldering combustion to destroy contaminants.  The goal of the self sustained smoldering bench test is to determine if this treatment technology is applicable to this site. The most concentrated contaminants remaining in the subsurface are believed to be in either sand, silt and silty sand at a depth between 25 - 35 ft below ground surface (bgs). The contaminants could be shallower or deeper. The volume of contaminants are assumed over 1,000,000 gallons in the form of DRO, GRO, ORO in concentrations range from non detect to over 100,000,000 ug/kg. The distribution of free phase and non-aqueous phase liquids is not known. There is no map available Soil contaminants sample cores must be extracted by drilling only no excavator can be used.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0002 $______________  <br>    <br>  Option CLIN 0003: Successful treatment of bench-scale smoldering testing will lead to a pilot scale evaluation at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI if funds are available.   <br>    <br>  There is no in-situ designed approach at this time, therefore the Pilot treatment is undefined.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0003 $_______________  <br>    <br>  Parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, on the items quoted including, but not limited to, technical brochures, specification sheets indicating technical ability, pictures, etc. sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.    <br>    <br>  Price shall include any shipping, FOB Destination.   <br>    <br>  FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall submit technical data on the items quoted.   <br>    <br>  FAR Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quote is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.   <br>    <br>  Supplement to FAR 52.212-5: The following FAR clauses are applicable to this acquisition: 52.222-3, 52.219-6, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.222- 37, 52.225-13 and 52.232-33.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (Jan 2011) Supplement to FAR 252.212-7001: The following FAR clauses are applicable to this acquisition: 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003.   <br>    <br>  Quotes are due 29 July 2013 by 5:00PM (Central Time Zone): Quotes will be accepted by email only to: Amanda.Andrews@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>FOR THE A-10 AIRCRAFT<br /><br />This notification is for market research purposes only to identify potential contractors who have the tooling, skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This effort is to manufacture Initial Spare Parts for the Enhanced Wing Assembly (EWA). Contractor will manufacture and supply spare parts to the Air Force supply chain so they will be available to support EWA unique requirements.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATION STATEMENT:</p>
<p>The Air Force requires EWA unique parts to support initial flying operations and testing of the new wing prior to provisioning efforts being completed and implemented. Therefore, this acquisition will be a contract to assure the short-term supportability of the EWA. Requirements for producing EWA parts include the demonstrated capability to manufacture according to 3D modeling information including tight tolerances. This 3D data is still in development and will be provided with short lead times requiring maximum flexibility in producing parts. Contractors will be required to demonstrate verification that 3D data imported to be used for manufacturing exactly matches organic source data. Contractors are also required to submit data demonstrating their ability to produce or utilize -- if they have available -- extensive tooling that is unique to the EWA assembly to assure proper end products and mating points/surfaces. They must also demonstrate the flexibility to change manufacturing processes should a design change necessitate it. This tooling is estimated to cost an initial investment of over $21M and 11 months to produce. Neither the tooling nor the data on how it was created will be available as GFE/GFI during the execution timeframe of this contract. The data must also verify the Contractor's capability to manufacture the parts and qualify first articles early enough to still be able to deliver the parts within the contractual period of performance. Contractors would also need to demonstrate their ability to deliver parts on a compressed time frame should demand necessitate it. The Contractor will be required to verify capabilities to manage component inventories, develop manufacturing testing (or demonstrate it if in place), and manufacture and test aerospace ready-for-use subassemblies with existing quality processes suitable for military aerospace applications.</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The Air Force's planned methodology will be a single purchase supply contract to procure initial spares with an anticipated Firm-Fixed-Price arrangement.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>&bull;Approximately 74 initial spare parts of varying quantities (approximately 170 total parts) to establish the pipeline of EWA unique spare parts.</p>
<p>&bull;The effort to produce initial spares has an estimated value of $2.8M with an estimated period of performance from Apr 2014 through Sep 2015.</p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall establish, implement, and maintain an Initial Spares Program in accordance with the listing of parts</p>
<p>&bull;When the prime contractor buys end articles or a portion thereof from a vendor/subcontractor, the prime contractor shall impose these specifications upon its vendors/subcontractors. The inclusion of the requirements on contractor's subcontracts/purchase orders to its vendor/subcontractors does not relieve the prime contractor of its obligation to insure timely delivery of the required deliverables.</p>

The efforts required is to find a source for the long term production and sustainment of two Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U, associated  Electronic Technical Manual, a list of Repair Parts and the Technical Data Package (TDP). <br>  <br> In addition, the Repair Parts necessary to support the Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U requirement will also be competed and evaluated through the Source Selection process.  As part of the evaluation process, contractors will be requested to include a baseline repair parts list with their proposals.  The repair parts list will be the offeror's design sparing strategy for the life of the contract. This list will be used for evaluation purposes. The government will evaluate the contractor's proposed repairs parts list to determine price reasonableness and to ensure the price proposal is not unbalanced.  The Solicitation will instruct the offerors that the Government is seeking only Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U unique parts and that common items, such as those that can be ordered from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or elsewhere in the Government's supply chain, are not desired by the Government and that the addition of common parts to the sparing list may adversely affect a contractor's competitiveness.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to order such common parts from DLA notwithstanding there potential inclusion in the contract being solicited here.   <br>  <br> While an effort has been made to include a comprehensive Repair Parts list in the contract, it is recognized that not all of the necessary Repair Parts have yet been identified.  It is anticipated that those items will be added to the baseline Repair Parts list as they are identified, but in no event will the additional costs associated with those items increase the overall ceiling price of the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract beyond that specified in the documentation supporting the Government's approval to enter into this contract.   <br>    <br> The tactical power supplies furnish 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32VDC from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.  The tactical power supply can also operate from a 24 VDC storage battery in the battery standby mode.  Full technical details of the tactical power supplies can be found in MIL-PRF-49080 Revision D, dated 17 March 2010, found at: https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=26824.  Notes: 1) Revision D contains new requirements and many differences relative to Revision C; 2) There is an Exceptions to Specifications, dated 30 May 2012, that will be included with the solicitation that updates the Point of Contact and changes the output cable's relationship to the output connector.  These details will be supplied with the future release of the RFP.  The tactical power supplies will be designed to be field maintainable with full instructions included in the Electronic Technical Manual.  The tactical power supplies will be required to undergo First Article Testing, will require configuration management control, and undergo periodic production testing.  Details of testing can be found in the aforementioned MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, dated 17 March 2010. <br>  <br> The Government intends to award a five-year ordering period, Firm-Fixed-Price, (FFP), IDIQ type contract as a Full and Open Competition after Exclusion of Sources pursuant to FAR Part 15 for Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U & PP-2953E/U.

The National Stock Numbers associated with the previous requirement were NSN: 6130-01-522-3494 and NSN: 6130-01-571-2142.  The NSN numbers will change, and new NSN numbers are in process of being assigned for this new acquisition.  The place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility; no contractors will need to have access to Army installations.  The anticipated and/or potential delivery schedule for PP-6224D/U is 100 - 400 units per month until completion, and for PP-2953E/U, an anticipated monthly delivery quantity of 100 - 250 units per month until completion.  Based on future and possible changing Government requirements, shorter lead times, or higher quantities, or concurrent deliveries may be required.  The quantities and lead times will be negotiated for the specific Delivery Order.  The combined delivery quantity of concurrent delivery orders of one or both Tactical Power Supplies is not required to exceed 500 total Power Supplies per month.  The mix of PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U will be determined by the Government at the time Delivery Orders are issued.

Belvoir, VA, only if the Government shutdown and ensuing Department of Defense furloughs have been lifted prior to the event with adequate time to prepare. A final decision will be made to postpone or proceed with the Industry Day by Friday 11 Oct 2013. Information will be provided to those who have registered for the event once a final determination is made. If the Industry Day is cancelled for 18 Oct 2013, the intent would most likely be to postpone it until after the DoD furlough has been lifted, and information will be provided accordingly to registrants if it is rescheduled.  <br>  <br> Registration Information for the Industry Day: Registration is required. The Industry Day will consist of a requirement overview briefing, a question and answer session and individual breakout sessions, if desired and as time allows. Due to resource demands and time limitations, requests will be fulfilled on a first come, first serve basis. Questions from interested vendors shall be submitted by 1400 EST on Friday, 11 October 2013 to brian.g.huffman3.civ@mail.mil to provide the Government adequate time to respond. Government responses will be provided at the Industry Day. Any questions marked proprietary will be treated as such by the Government. Information from the Industry Day, including slides and audio of the Government presentation, will be posted on the registration page after the Industry Day is completed.  <br>  <br> Registration for the Industry Day is at the following link: http://www3.natick.army.mil/Team/PARANAVSYS.aspx Please click on the  quote mark Register for Industry Day quote mark  link and complete the required fields and click submit.

<DESC><p>The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) plans to issue a Request for&nbsp;Quote (RFQ) to stop the infiltration of river water into the dewatering pits in the north downstream approach walls at both Eisenhower and Snell Locks in Massena, New York.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> Each lock has a dewatering pit that is equipped with pumps which maintain general drainage of the lock facility and are also used to remove water from the lock chamber below low pool elevation to facilitate maintenance work. </span>At each lock, the pumps are located in recesses in the concrete approach wall approximately 15 feet below the top of the wall and pump water from pits located below the floors of these recesses. Water infiltration through horizontal joints/seams in the concrete near the bottoms of the pump recesses requires excessive pumping to keep the dewatering pits dry. Although the Contractor may choose its own methods, the SLSDC feels the objective may best be accomplished by injecting sealant material into drilled holes that intersect the water infiltration paths. <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Plans are to award the work in September 2013, dependent upon the availability of funds. Quotes must be valid for sixty (60) days to allow for a later award, if necessary. The work is to be completed within sixty (60) days of the award. The RFQ will be released on&nbsp;August 14, 2013, with a response date of approximately September 13, 2013. The cost range is between </span>$25,000 and $100,000. The SLSDC will furnish the specifications and drawings in electronic format at the cost of $20.00. Prospective offerors interested in purchasing the CD may pay by check payable to the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, 180 Andrews Street, Massena, NY 13662, or by debit or credit card at www.pay.gov and selecting the miscellaneous payment from under the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The fee is non-refundable. NAICS Code: 238110, Size Standard: $14.0M. This is a total small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. An anticipated firm, fixed price contract will be awarded. Prospective offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov to be eligible for award. The Department of Transportation (DOT) Short Term Lending Program (STLP) offers financial Assistance to eligible disadvantaged, HUBZone, or service disabled veteran owned businesses.

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

1. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be
subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.



3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	The C&A requirements do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
h.	   Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
(1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

(a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
(b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.



7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) Date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:


(1)	Notification;
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 
3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)	Data breach analysis;
(4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and 
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit 
records, histories, or financial affairs.

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to
evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

9. TRAINING
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(1)	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
(2)	Successfully complete the "VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior FY12 - Print" training and annually complete required security training. The training is accessible on 
https://www.tms.va.gov/plateau/user/login.jsp
(3)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR
This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.
1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONTRACT:
a.	I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.
b.	I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking, tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.
c.	I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel.
d.	I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.
e.	I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).
 
f.	I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.
g.	I understand I must comply with VA's security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COTR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
h.	I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COTR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
a.	Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
b.	The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1)	Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2)	Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3)	I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4)	Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5)	Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COTR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not
 
confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6)	Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7)	Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8)	Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9)	Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
(10)	Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11)	Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders.
(12)	Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13)	Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR.
(14)	Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR.
 
(15)	Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16)	Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR.
(17)	Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18)	Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
a.	When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.
b.	Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
c.	I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COTR.
d.	I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.
4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION
This User Agreement does not and should not be relied upon to create any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law, by a party to litigation with the United States Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will  <br> not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF31754125 is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses under NAICS Code 332312 with size standards not exceeding 500 employees. <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) has been tasked by the U.S. Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to provide materials to the Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT). Storage of these materials during transport requires intermodal shipping containers to prevent moisture intrusion, which could decrease the performance of these materials. The materials must be stored on sturdy racks to prevent shifting of the materials during transport. Two hundred and seventy(270) metal supersack racks are required to evaluate the performance of multiple packaging configurations using currently available technologies. We have already designed these racks and  <br> demonstrated their effectiveness. Our welding shop on station constructed the racks we are currently using (pictures attached). The welding shop had too much work to fulfill the large quantity required for this action. We require duplicates of our existing racks. These will be delivered FOB destination to the Engineer Research and Development Center, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199. Requirements are given below: <br>  <br> REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> 1. Racks should be capable of stacking for storage purposes. Any design is acceptable as long as it is capable of supporting 3,500 lbs of weight that will be applied from the rack and contents that will be stacked above. <br> 2. Racks should be made of A-36 steel. <br> 3. Racks should be fabricated according to the attached file named: quote mark SupersackRacksDwg quote mark. <br>  <br> Racks may be powder coated (black) instead of regular liquid painted...either is technically acceptable. <br>  <br> The footer portion was constructed using a press to uniformly apply pressure to the metal to mold it to a semiround shape. Therefore the shape of the footer does not produce sharp angles. The approximate angle of the footer is 30 degrees. Material thickness is 0.25 inches; size of hole is 2 inches by 2 inches square. The shape <br> appears more round after the material is pressed. (See attached pictures for reference) <br>  <br> A separate piece was welded to the inside of the tube steel so that part #G can be welded to it. The separate piece should have a thickness of 0.25 inch. <br>  <br> No markings are required for the racks. <br>  <br> The contractor is responsible for transporting the supersack racks to the ERDC in Vicksburg, MS. <br>  <br> Containers must be received by the ERDC no later than 12 weeks after award. <br>  <br> Please provide quote as follows: <br>  <br> CLIN 0001 - Description: Supersack Racks, Quantity: 270, Unit: Each, Total Price: $____________ <br>  <br> CLIN 0002 - Description: Shipping (FOB Destination), Quantity: 1, Unit: Lump Sum, Price: $__________ <br>  <br> FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.
