15. Mandatory Language:   
The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is a full and open requirement.  All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.   
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.   
The Contractor is required to be "Export Controlled" certified to receive and view the drawings for this solicitation.  To become certified, register at website www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp (for guidance, go to FAQ).  Foreign owned firms are advised to contact Christopher Lally at (405) 734-8112 or email christopher.lally.1@us.af.mil before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions to receiving an award.   
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR).  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards.   
First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it. All other offerors can apply for a waiver of First Article approval under the following condition(s): Offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar article to the prime contractor for delivery to the Government; offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Government, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Government; provided not more than 36 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.  Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.   
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download on the release date only from www.fbo.gov.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Christopher Lally at (405) 734-8112 or email at christopher.lally.1@us.af.mil.

Over the past 7 years, NASA ARC has partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a number of activities focused on the development of small / medium satellites, satellite systems and subsystems, assembly integration and test, mission assurance, mission design, responsive manufacturing, ground operations, and launch services - often employing innovative approaches in order to accelerate acquisition timelines. Several of these capabilities are currently being met through a suite of contracts, awarded in 2010, under a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract titled "Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW)" and a multiple award IDIQ contract titled "Modular Space Vehicle (MSV)". The SSPEDI acquisition is envisioned to serve as a follow-on to the RRSW and MSV contracts in the continued pursuit of innovative and affordable approaches through basic research, applied research, and advanced development focused on, but not limited to, payloads, buses (i.e. spacecraft subsystems such as life support; attitude control; guidance, navigation and control; command and data handling; communications system and antennas; power; thermal control; propulsion; and structures and trusses), ground systems / infrastructure and launch systems. The requirement will be split into two requirements described below that are separate but interrelated:&nbsp;</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Space Solutions (SpS), a multiple award contract, focuses on the development of small to medium buses, payloads, and space vehicles based on specific technical and mission requirements for ORS.</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Primary place of performance will be: The Contractors' Facilities.</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">A Request for Information (RFI) NNA16SSPEDI-L for this activity was posted on July 12, 2016.&nbsp;<br /></span>

<RESPDATE>052417
<CONTACT>Orlando V. Holloway, Phone 8042796740, Email orlando.holloway@dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to support DLA's Strategic Sourcing and Automated BHTI Catalog / BOA initiatives.  This strategic effort includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems / operational platforms associated with the BHTI Military Spares Catalog. A total of 440 NSNs are targeted for this RFP and contract action. It is anticipated that 440 items will be priced for the contract award. OEM Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) is the approved source of supply for these items; therefore, the proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to the OEM.
<p><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLA Procurement Note 04, Government Surplus Property Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items in accordance with the aforementioned acquisition strategy. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Wednesday, May 24, 2017.  A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 440 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The anticipated closing date is Friday, June 09, 2017.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service has chosen to cancel the current VIPR pre-season I-BPAs for National Crew Carrier Buses (awarded under solicitation AG-024B-S-14-7000) in accordance with Section C.3.3 of that agreement. The current Agreements will remain in effect until such time that the new Agreements are awarded (estimated 2nd quarter fiscal year 2018). The reasoning for this cancelation is that there are new safety requirements that need to be incorporated into the specifications for Crew Carrier Buses provided under this agreement. These changes were out of scope and could not be done under the current agreement. There is a current synopsis posted to FBO.gov for the new requirement 12024B-18-Q-7000 (originally posted incorrectly as 12024B-Q-18-7000). The draft specifications for this requirement can be found at https://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/solicitations.php . Please hold any questions related to these specifications until the solicitation is posted.  The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for Local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) System.  To use VIPR you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http:www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorapp.php  The VIPR helpdesk phone number is 866-224-7677.

<DESC>General Information<br />Short Title: Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Membership Renewal<br />Document Type: Presolicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: N02CO82505-36 <br />Posted Date: 11/3/2017<br />Response Date: 11/14/2017<br />Classification Code: B529-Scientific Data Studies <br />NAICS Code: 518210 - Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services<br /><br />Contracting Office Address
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E232 Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) is a global, open, multidisciplinary, non-profit organization that provides federal regulatory standards to support the acquisition, exchange, submission and archive of clinical research data and metadata. The CDISC mission is to develop and support global, platform-independent data standards that enable information system interoperability to improve clinical research. There is no comparable organization, as CDISC standards are cited in guidance for data submissions to FDA with which the NCI must comply.</p>
<p>The NCI maintains an institutional membership in this organization and participates as a major partner and collaborator in the development of these standards, which are required for clinical and pre-clinical data submissions to the FDA and other international regulators. There is no comparable or competing organization for the development of these standards. The NCI organizational membership provides conference discounts, free educational meetings, access to all CDISC intellectual products such as implementation guides which are used by NCI, access to all data in the CDISC SHARE database, and representative positions on CDISC Advisory Groups.</p>
<p>The purpose of the acquisition is to procure CDISC membership. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System code is 518210 and the business size standard is $32,500,000.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract with a base and four option periods.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>CDISC works with NCI on various regulated research data standards, such as for standardized case report forms, research domain models including the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model, and other products that provide a common framework for data exchange.<br />CDISC is working actively with NCI's Enterprise Vocabulary Services to develop and support controlled terminology in several areas, notably CDISC's Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM). SDTM is an international standard for clinical research data, and is required by the FDA as a standard electronic submission format. Common data collection and submission standards that are collaboratively developed include:<br />CDISC SDTM, which includes standard terminology covering demographics, interventions, findings, events, trial design, units, frequency, and ECG terminology. FDA currently receives submissions using this standard. This terminology is maintained and distributed as part of NCI Thesaurus.<br />CDISC Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) Standard, a clinical research study content standard developed in collaboration with sixteen partner organizations including NCI. NCI EVS maintains and distributes CDASH controlled terminology as part of NCI Thesaurus.<br />CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADaM), which supports efficient generation, replication, review, and submission of analysis results from clinical trial data. NCI EVS maintains and distributes ADaM controlled terminology as part of NCI Thesaurus.<br />CDISC also leads the Standard for the Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) project, which guides the organization, structure and format of standard preclinical tabulation data sets for interchange between organizations such as sponsors and CROs, and for submission to a regulatory authority such as the FDA. FDA currently receives submissions using this standard. NCI EVS maintains and distributes SEND controlled terminology as part of NCI Thesaurus.<br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM EST, on November 14, 2017. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5401 or emailed to David Romley, Contract Specialist OR via electronic mail at david.romley@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02CO82505-36 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis for noncommercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 5.207 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, despite the fact it is not required based on the cited sole source authority below. This requirement is being posted to maximize communication with industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This procurement is being processed on an unrestricted basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541330.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Small Business Size Standard is $38,500,000.00.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to Award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract modification to existing bridge contract N66604-17-C-3107 with L3 Unidyne (L3).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this bridge contract modification is to increase the hour and dollar ceiling and extend the period of performance, to provide continuity of Fleet critical services in support of the Naval Array Technical Support Center (NATSC) while corrective action is taken as a result of the Government Accountability Office's (GAOs) sustainment of the protest of award received under fair opportunity follow-on Request for Proposal (RFP) N66604-17-R-3047, awarded under the SeaPort-e Multiple Award Contract (MAC) vehicle.</p>
<p>NUWCDIVNPT intends to purchase the following items:</p>
<p>CLIN 4000: NATSC FACILITY OPERATION SERVICES (Cost Plus Fixed Fee)</p>
<p>CLIN 5000:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other Direct Costs associated with CLIN 4000 (Cost Reimbursement)</p>

<p>This modification will extend the period of performance end date of basic contract N66604-17-C-3107 from 15 November 2017 to 30 July 2018. The place of performance is the primarily at the NATSC facility with minimal contractor facility work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract modification is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2), which justifies the use of other than full and open competition when the need for services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that serious injury would result to the Navy without them. L3 is the only source with the requisite knowledge and expertise to provide uninterrupted comprehensive support.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date of this modification is expected to be on or about 15 November 2017.</p>
<p>The synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals due to the urgent and compelling nature.</p>
<p>Information shall be submitted prior to the anticipated award date via email to all of the following points of contact: Alison Wicks at alison.c.wicks@navy.mil, Nathaniel Barber at nathaniel.barber@navy.mil, and Andrew Nagelhout at andrew.c.nagelhout@navy.mil.</p>

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; mso-pagination: none;" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Notice of Intent</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">NAICS Code: 811219 Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-12-003, as described below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The US Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) has installed one and hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. Operators at the stations perform basic operations, primarily starting and stopping the air sampler to change filters. At most locations, a mechanical or instrument technician is not available to correct problems. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During normal operations, filters are changed by a local operator and mailed to EPA laboratory for analysis. During sample collection, the monitoring stations continuously monitor the filter for accumulation of radioactive material. The radiation measurements are stored by the monitoring station and transmitted, both automatically and on demand, via communications systems that are an integral pat of the monitoring station, to the EPA&rsquo;s National Analytical Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL), in Montgomery, Alabama. Whenever deemed necessary, NAREL remotely connects with one or more monitoring stations to initiate transfer of additional data and/or to modify operation parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent contractor provides the on-site maintenance and repair of these monitors. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The current contract, EP-D-12-003, period of performance was extended for six months from December 11, 2016 to June 11, 2017 via Far Clause 52.217-8&mdash;Option to Extend Services. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and two one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of June 11, 2017 of contract EP-D-12-003. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional three months, with three (3) 1-month optional extension periods to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate, this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by ORIA in order to maintain the one hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at the outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This notice will be posted for 5 days. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-003, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (</span><a href="mailto:Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">) within <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">5 days</strong> from the date of this notice.</span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army is issuing a Sources Sought RFI notice as a means of conducting market research to identify sources having an interest and capabilities to support a requirement for spare parts and special tools for the M3P .50 CAL Heavy Machine Pod Aircraft Weapon System (HMP 400). The HMP 400, a mounting platform for the M3P .50CAL machine guns is attached to helicopter bodies that arms helicopters not expressly designed with inherent weapons capability. Since the listed part numbers are brand name specific, interested sources cannot propose alternate part numbers. The results of this RFI will be used by U.S. Army to determine the method of procurement for the following special tools and spare parts in the attachment.

 Draft Statement of Work (SOW)
PART I: GENERAL INFORMATION
A. Introduction
The Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (RLRVAMC), Indianapolis, IN requires an Air Handler HVAC Filter Changing Program.
B. Scope
The Air Handler HVAC Filter Changing Program shall include all air handlers and fan coil units located throughout the facility. 
HVAC Units shall have Outside Air intake cleaned when filters are changed along with Outside Air/ Mixed Air Chambers. A complete cleaning of the mentioned compartments and screens is required. Contractor shall replace required micro-biocide tablets in condensate pans, the VA will provide the tablets. 
Fan coil units shall be cleaned, drain pans cleaned, fan housings and squirrel cage s cleaned and microbicide tablets replaced when changing filters. A small amount of bleach may be required for drain pans during summer months if slime is present. .  The VA will purchase the micro-biocide tablets.
The Contractor shall maintain a filter change record throughout the life of the contract. This shall be provided to the COR on a monthly basis.
The Contractor shall provide competent staff that are familiar with HVAC equipment and can show industry certification and continuing education.
The Contractor shall store all filters at an off-site location. Contractor shall not store any filters at the facilities. 
All used filters shall be removed from site once new filters are installed and disposed of off-site by the Contractor.
The representative shall be available 24/7 and under emergency circumstances, should be able to visit our site within four (4) hours after being notified

RLRVAMC has 58 Air Handling Units (AHU) and 375 (+/- 25) Fan Coil Units. Due to construction and demolition this number can change over the course of the contract however variance would be minimal. The systems include various manufacturers that include York, Trane, Carrier etc. and range in age from 1986 to present. Initially filters shall be changed according to attached filter schedule however this is subject to change as filter efficiencies are evaluated both by RLRVAMC and contractor. (Note: This may result in reduction of services thus reducing total costs to VA)
Work shall be performed primarily during normal business hours, Monday thru Friday. An exception to this would be if cleaning is required in the Outside Air/ Mixed Air Chambers. Some fan coil units are in patient care areas which may require multiple visits to that area in order to complete change out. This holds true in some business/office areas as well.  The only other exception would be emergency change out of filters due to weather related damage, and emergency equipment repair. 
Due to the nature of the facility, patent care focus, response and turnaround time is of major importance which may require a two (2) hour response time primarily in reference to individual filter change out on identified units or response to filter changes required because of utility interruption, and or emergency.
Coordination of unit shut down for filter change will be with the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and or Chiller Plant Operator.

<p style="text-align: center;"><br />DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Low Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging Console<br />NB686080-18-00116</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI) program requires a control console that is capable of producing signs from 10kHz to 300 MHz with 2 RF transmit and receive channels, 3 gradient channels, and control signals (TTL). These capabilities must cover the range of experiments necessary for low-field magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes use of RF excitation of nuclear spins and Gradient shapes to produce images. These excitations need a high degree of uniformity and control. The control hardware must be able to produce gradient shapes in 3 directions (X,Y,Z). The control hardware for an MRI must handle precise timings of these events without error. For the low magnetic field operation in this project (1-10 mT) the low radiofrequency (kHz regime) is used to excite water protons in systems under observation.</p>
<p>This item will also support part of a ARPA-E ROOTS (Advanced Research Programs Agengy-Energy Rhizosphere Observations Optimizing Terrestrial Sequestration) program.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>

<p>2. 2 Digital receivers at least 14-bit 50 MHz Analog-to-Digital Converters with &gt; 80 dB of gain. 1 GByte of memory on each Signal Averager.</p>
<p>3. 3 Gradient control signals. Each Digital signal processor much have 64 million points of memory. Included should be a gradient rotation board for oblique imaging and shimming of X, Y, and Z through gradient coils. Gradient control outputs should be output on Twinax connectors with any necessary filtering to remove low frequency noise.</p>
<p>4. 4th gradient channel to function as AWG. 64 million points of wave form control, 20-bit resolution, +/- 5V signal on BNC connection.</p>
<p>5. Integrated system with power distribution, RF interface panel, swept frequency coil tuning, and double shielded RF cables.</p>
<p>6. Software licensing for instrument control and data processing</p>
<p>7. Preamplifiers: One from .1 to 100 MHz with &gt; 110 dB of gain, One from 5 to 500 MHz with &gt;110 dB gain.</p>
<p>8. Transcouplers: One from 10 to 100 MHz and Two from 100 to 500 MHz.</p>
<p>9. &frac14; wavelength plug ins for filtering below 10 MHz and from 100 to 500 MHz</p>
<p>10. Proven use in low field MRI application (1-10 mT; proton frequency 40-400kHz). Vendor must provide references of systems in use which NIST will contact.</p>

In order for the US Navy to identify and troubleshoot specific abnormalities and equipment operation issues currently installed on CVN-78, the unit to be used for testing must be identical, in all aspects including its machining, hardware and software details, to the shipboard unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, any attempts to reverse engineer the design of this unit, by another company, would not duplicate unique shipboard system abnormalities for troubleshooting analyses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the unit that NSWCPD is conducting testing and troubleshooting efforts upon is not identical, in all respects, the testing and troubleshooting will waste Navy time, resources, and funds, as test results and troubleshooting information would not be applicable to the Navy's needs and thus could not be used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FEC Lead Unit is the only equipment suitable for these unique testing, troubleshooting and training efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FEC is the only provider and proprietor for this custom system.

Additionally, the shipbuilder has relied heavily on FEC during installation to align, groom and troubleshoot during the installation. There have been a multitude of complications with the installations of the AWE system on CVN 78, causing major setbacks and delays. FEC has been integral to troubleshooting these issues and providing resolutions. The lessons learned from the initial unit and eleven shipboard system installations and operation have resulted in improved installation procedures. The AWE system has extremely tight tolerances and requires specialized equipment and knowledge to reduce the risk of incurring costly installation and integration errors. FEC is the only vendor that has and continues to acquire the specialized experience and knowledge needed provide the greatest potential for a successful installation and integration.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"MARKET RESEARCH" N00030-20-C-0001</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice. This notice is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation exists at this time. The Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) seeks a contract for subject matter expertise regarding the SSP Naval Treaty Implementation Program (NTIP) arms control implementation and compliance effort in accordance with various treaties as described below.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF NOTICE: The Sources Sought is being used as a Market Research tool to determine potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a potential RFP. The Government is only requesting capability statements from potential contractors at this time. Responders should, at a minimum, address the items below:</p>
<p>&bull; Describe your firm's overall approach and operating model for meeting the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) and describe your firm's experience in providing similar services to those described in the SOW</p>
<p>&bull; Explain your recommended structure, expertise, and staffing approach to meet the requirements of the SOW</p>
<p>&bull; In your experience, what contract type and structure provides the Government and contractor with the most flexibility to adjust staffing as requirements change during performance? How would you construct a contract to provide flexibility to support temporary staffing surges to meet emergent requirements without expanding the number of full time equivalents (FTEs)?</p>
<p>&bull; In your experience, how are other Federal Government organizations, particularly DoD entities, procuring similar services?</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a list of government contract vehicles on which you are currently or have performed similar services in the past five (5) years. For each, please include the following information:</p>
<p>a. Title of effort<br />b. Name and contact information (telephone and e-mail address) for Government point of contact.<br />c. Contract number<br />d. Contract Type (FFP, Cost Reimbursement, etc.)<br />e. Award Type (Single or Multiple)<br />f. Contract Period of Performance<br />g. Contract value (ceiling if IDIQ)<br />h. Number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) and types of services being provided</p>
<p>Any and all information submitted in response to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary, and in no way obligates the U.S. Government to any type of monetary compensation or otherwise to make a contract award. All data and information submitted shall become property of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>No classified or confidential information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s). Responders should clearly indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. Failure to provide a response does not preclude participation in any possible future competitive RFP for which a business is eligible to participate in, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the interested businesses to monitor the FEDBIZOPS website for additional information pertaining to any potential acquisition and obtain security clearances, if necessary, to perform the SOW.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENT: SSP NTIP supports the Fleet and the DON organizations with expert arms control implementation and compliance assistance. NTIP is responsible for coordinating DON (United States Navy and United States Marine Corps) implementation and compliance for designated arms control treaties worldwide. The NTIP mission is dynamic and is driven by current trends in international affairs. The NTIP mission is also subject to the U.S. government's emphasis on and priorities for arms control implementation and compliance, which can fluctuate based on the national security priorities of the Executive and Legislative branches.</p>
<p>NTIP is researching the capabilities of companies that have arms control implementation and compliance experience. NTIP provides comprehensive arms control treaty support to Navy and Marine Corps commanding officers, program managers, senior leadership, and decision-makers. NTIP serves as the Department of the Navy's lead in all matters relating to implementation and compliance. SECNAV INSTRUCTION 5710.23C requires that all Navy and Marine Corps programs and activities must be compliant with international arms control treaties and U.S. policies at every stage of the acquisition life cycle, from research and development, acquisition to deployment. The NTIP Compliance Assessment Program conducts comprehensive arms control compliance assessments of these programs and activities. NTIP is also responsible for preparing all DON facilities that may be subject to intrusive international verification measures. In the event of a treaty-related activity such as an Open Skies overflight or a Chemical Weapons Convention challenge inspection, NTIP provides support to the affected Navy or Marine Corps facility or activity to ensure full compliance with all treaty obligations while simultaneously safeguarding national security.</p>
<p>NTIP is responsible for DON implementation and compliance with over forty arms control treaties and agreements. However, it should be noted that NTIP is not responsible for implementation and compliance activities associated with New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START).</p>
<p>As a result of the team's analysis, the NTIP acquisition is best defined and/or described in NAICS Code 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) and is hereby recommended as the Primary NAICS Code for the NTIP acquisition.</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements, strategic alliances, or other business arrangements to satisfy this requirement are encouraged and welcomed.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a request for proposal or quote or an invitation for bid. Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential (SAM) Database registered businesses interested and capable of performing this work.
<p><br />NAICS CODE: 237990</p>
<p>SIZE STANDARD: $36.5 Million</p>
<p>ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION RANGE: $5M - $10M</p>
<p>POINT OF CONTACT: Responses are to be sent via email to Contract Specialist, Liz Dennison at elizabeth.a.dennison@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00 am Central Time on Friday, December 1, 2017.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Starved Rock and Marseilles Lock and Dam Upper Bulkhead Recesses. The project includes installation of bulkhead recesses (BHR) on the upper end of the land and river walls. The BHR will be installed in the recess area that currently accepts emergency miter gates (used for dewatering the lock chamber in the past). Additionally, a new concrete sill will need to be installed adjacent to the existing emergency miter gate sill. The work shall include concrete removal (wire sawing &amp; coring), concrete placement (to include fabrication and placement of pre-cast panels), rebar and anchor installation, drilled shafts, and fabrication and placement of the steel bulkhead recess. Underwater anchor installation and concrete placement will be required. This will be a construction contract to be primarily constructed during a navigation restriction period from early-June 2019 through late-August/early-September 2019. The restriction period will most likely allow for construction activity during daytime hours and then open up to pass navigation traffic at night. Construction will need to take place at both sites concurrently. Construction will take place in the wet, however, there is potential that cofferdams may be utilized for localized dewatering. The work is anticipated to be performed from a floating plant. It is anticipated that prior to construction, the existing emergency gates will be removed by government personnel. It is expected that divers will be necessary to support concrete sill &amp; precast panel installation.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION DETAILS: All interested, responsive and responsible System for Award Management (SAM) Database registered businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research by emailing the required information below to the point of contact listed above.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only, and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION: The Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) Survivability Upgrade (SU) Program is an Acquisition Category III program. The Marine Corps' Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV7A1) Family of Vehicles fleet consists of three (3) variants: Personnel Carrier (P7), Command and Control (C7), and Recovery (R7). Science Applications International Corporation, Incorporated (SAIC) is currently providing a SU material solution to the Marine Corps AAV P7 and C7 variants under Contract M67854-14-C-0002. The AAV SU is an upgrade for crew/troop force protection and survivability. The AAV SU provides enhanced protection to the crew and embarked Marines with increased underbelly armor, blast mitigating seats, external fuel cells, and redesigned external armor. <br /><br />1.1 Purpose: This RFI constitutes market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and is not a <br />Request for Proposal (RFP). Program Executive Officer Land Systems is issuing this RFI, as part of the AAV SU Program, to assess industry's capability to produce approximately 357 AAV SU full rate production (FRP) vehicles, and provide engineering; integration and testing; logistics; maintenance training devices and updates; and program management support services, as needed.</p>
<p>1.2 Objective: Data submitted in response to this RFI will be used to assess the marketplace environment for providing the U.S. Marine Corps (Marine Corps) with approximately 357 AAV SU FRP vehicles, and for providing the engineering; integration and testing; logistics; maintenance training devices and updates; and program management support services, as needed for the vehicles.</p>
<p>1.3 Key Events: The anticipated contract award date for FRP is June 2019 in order to meet operational need dates for delivery of AAV SU FRP vehicles to the Operating Forces in April of 2020.</p>
<p>2.0 BACKGROUND: A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option lot quantity of 18 vehicles was exercised in fourth quarter FY17 with a contract end date of second quarter FY18. An LRIP option lot quantity of 30 vehicles may be exercised upon successful completion of the current LRIP lot. The LRIP vehicles are being built and tested by SAIC in accordance with the Government's AAV SU performance specification and Statement of Work.</p>
<p>2.1 Concept of Operations: The AAV provides ship-to-objective armored transport for the Ground Combat Element. The mobility of the AAV SU allows the vehicle to operate effectively with M1A1 main battle tanks and other motorized/mechanized forces as well as the conduct of mounted security operations in urban or restrictive terrain alongside wheeled and tracked vehicles of the MAGTF. The AAV SU will support the volume and weight associated with twenty Marines (seventeen embarked infantry and three crewmen) with full combat load, one additional day of supply, and mission essential equipment. The AAV SU will continue to operate as part of the maneuver task forces built around the Marine Infantry battalion and facilitate maneuver throughout a given operating area to include the ability to cross rivers and inland waterways.</p>
<p>2.2 Design, Test and Manufacturing Data: <br /><br />An AAV SU Preliminary Design Review (PDR)/Critical Design Review (CDR) phase was competitively awarded to two vendors in May of 2014. Both contracts for PDR/CDR also contained options for the Engineering, Maintenance and Design Prototype and LRIP vehicle builds.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">On 01 Aug 13, the United States Army MEDCOM awarded the current contract as a firm fixed price contract with a one year base and four one-year option periods to CACI-ISS, Inc., (CAGE Code 49DW9) on task order (TO) W81K04-13-F-0013.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This TO was awarded off of the GSA Professional Services Schedule (GS-10F-0528N).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance for TO W81K04-13-F-0013 will end on 31 July 18.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Responsibility for executing the ECMM contract is transitioning from the Army to the Air Force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As part of this transition, the performance work statement (PWS) is being reviewed in an effort to enhance competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The revision of the contract requirement to enhance competition has delayed the procurement process.</span></p>

<p>OVERVIEW &amp; BACKGROUND</p>
<p>LBNL seeks further information about the scope and breadth of your company, its capability and options to provide Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) Remediation Services on the LBNL Remediation, Demolition, and Disposal (LRDD) Project. <br /> <br />LBNL will transform the current infrastructure into industrial use "brownfields" for future redevelopment. This service includes the remediation, demolition, and disposal of several buildings located on the 200-acre campus. The facilities slated for D&amp;D historically performed radiochemistry research, as well as most of the buildings have previously hosted radioactive isotopes, beryllium, or hazardous chemicals. Reconnaissance level characterization has shown that there are distributed radiological contaminants in the concrete and soil. Essentially, all buildings have enough asbestos in siding, roof and floor tiles and lead paint to require special handling. The facilities also partially overlay a groundwater plume with Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) contamination that is being remediated by a pump-and-treat system subject to regulation by state (California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)) and local environmental agencies.</p>
<p>LBNL has certain constraints including coordination with operating facilities (such as the Advanced Light Source), adjacent construction activities (such as Old Town Phase I wrap up activities and the Integrated Genome building), limited staging area and parking.</p>
<p>The terrain at LBNL is very steep, and was terraced to place the buildings. All buildings have slab foundations, with some of the bottom-level-floors' back walls doubling as retaining walls.<br /> <br />LBNL will host an industry day to further explore options for structuring its LRDD subcontract and seeks more information about availability and capability of potential providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>****PLEASE NOTE THAT NO CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED REGARDING THIS NOTICE. ANY INQUIRIES MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO <br />MICHAEL DRUMMOND, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, AT <a href="mailto:MICHAEL.DRUMMOND@NOAA.GOV">MICHAEL.DRUMMOND@NOAA.GOV</a>****</strong></p>
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), hereby gives public notice of the intent to negotiate a sole-source, five-year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract pursuant to the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for brand-name equipment under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 637(h) Award of Contracts; Procedures Other Than Competitive One; Exceptions, as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-1(c)(1), which allows for "an acquisition or portion of an acquisition that uses a brand-name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand-name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer."</p>
<p>NOAA's NMFS is responsible for the stewardship of the nation's ocean resources and their habitat. It provides vital services for the nation: productive and sustainable fisheries, safe sources of seafood, the recovery and conservation of protected resources, and healthy ecosystems --- all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management. The equipment to be purchased serves NMFS's missions by providing acoustic technology, which is only available through Kongsberg Underwater Technologies, Inc. (Kongsberg). Their equipment includes unique acoustic technology which is used for fish surveys and stock assessments.</p>
<p>Kongsberg is the industry standard for acoustic surveying and assessment equipment and it is used by NOAA on all its vessels, by other Government entities, and by many international scientific collaborating organizations around the world. <br />Some of the equipment to be purchased from Kongsberg will include, but not be limited to, the following: Wide Band Autonomous Transceivers (WBAT); WBAT deployment batteries; ES70-18CD and ES333-7CD split-beam, composite, depth rated transducers; split-beam, Depth Rated composite transducers compatible with WBAT; WBAT Test battery; WBAT Test Battery charger; Wide Band Transceivers (WBT); and second frequency licensing for WBT.</p>
<p>The IDIQ will be for five years because NMFS needs Kongsberg equipment not only today but well into the future. The IDIQ will eliminate the time and expense of having to award multiple separate contracts. In addition, NMFS will obtain the benefits of Kongsberg's evolving technology over time as it develops more advanced products.</p>
<p>Small Business Act 15 U.S.C. &sect; 637(h) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1(c)(1) establish the authority whereby an agency may issue a sole-source award.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be provided within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit, in writing, an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include proof of possessing permits and a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information, demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <strong>Affirmative written responses must be received</strong> no later than <strong>8:00 AM (Pacific), Monday, November 20, 2017</strong>.

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) intent to issue, on a sole-source basis, a firm fixed-price purchase order to SP Plus Corporation. for seven (7) reserved parking spaces with the ability to add parking spaces as personnel needs require, in a secure parking structure. The SSA, Office of Inspector General (OIG) has a requirement to lease parking spaces for U.S. Government Vehicles. The parking spaces will be used by OIG law enforcement agents who need to keep their government issued vehicles and equipment safe and secure. The parking spaces will meet the requirements of providing quick access to the vehicles, and in a secure parking structure located within one block of the OIG office located at 600 W. Madison Street, 3rd Floor - OIG, Chicago, IL 60661. Under Federal Acquisition Procedures (FAR) Part 6.302.1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Sources Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, SP+ Parking Garage is uniquely qualified to provide the required parking garage access at the Parking at Presidential Towers Garage, located at 555 West Madison Street, Chicago, IL 60661. This location is required because it is the only garage that satisfies OIG's requirement that OIG law enforcement officers park their vehicles in a secure facility within one block of the OIG office. The period of performance will be for twelve (12) months, beginning of December 1, 2017 through November 30, 2018 with the option of an additional four (4) option years.
<p>OIG defines "secure" as having either a 24/7 gate or guard-controlled accessible parking, and it desires such a facility to be within a one-block radius of the building in which the law enforcement officers work. Such nearby parking allows OIG law enforcement officers to have expedient and judicious access to the vehicles assigned to them, and does not require OIG officers to transport sensitive or valuable information and/or equipment a great distance. Additionally, a secure facility protects OIG's valuable vehicles that are often equipped with law enforcement technology. <br />The parking garage will have twenty-four (24) hour access by any means (attendant, key card, key, etc., at no additional cost to the government). Vehicles will not be double parked, and will remain locked at all times. Keys will not be left with an attendant. Self-parking capability and unlimited in and out privileges are required.<br />This requirement is utilizing procedures in FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with procedures in FAR Part 13. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this Notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received by 5:00PM EST on 11/09/2017, in accordance with FAR 13-106-1(b)(1) negotiations will be conducted with SP Plus Corporation. as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<SOLNBR>W912WJ18X0004
<RESPDATE>112417
<CONTACT>Alysha MacDonald, Phone 9783188715, Email Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (the estimated construction magnitude is between $25,000,000.00 and $35,000,000.00) construction project:
<p>The location of the work to be performed under this contract shall be in and along the Muddy River from Leverett Pond to Boylston Street in Boston and Brookline, Massachusetts. The project scope of work consists of dredging 1 to 5 feet of sediment from the bottom of the river to construct the Flood Risk Management channel, stabilizing the material for transport, and trucking the material for disposal in landfills. The estimated total quantity of material removal is about 100,000 cy. To accomplish this construction, it will require dewatering sections of the Muddy River using sheet pile cofferdams; pump systems to divert the river's flow; construction of temporary access roads along the river bank; removal and control of phragmites along the river edges; and dredging of and stabilizing the material for transport. Some of the dredging may be possible without dewatering. Included as part of this work is the construction of a flood protection wall and subsurface pumping station at the Boston Fire Department Building.</p>
<p>To avoid impacts to aquatic resources, environmental windows of 1 April to 15 June and 15 September to 1 November of any year has been set for the project. The management of anadromous fish (blueback herring), such that the adults are allowed to migrate upstream to spawn during the spring environmental window and the juveniles to migrate downstream to mature in the ocean during the fall environmental window, is required.</p>
<p>Due to the urban setting of the project location, extensive management of pedestrian and vehicular traffic at construction access points and at each work areas is required to minimize impacts to the roadways and parkland system and to ensure the safety of the public. The Contractor will have limited work area with very limited access.</p>
<p>The project is set within and part of the Historic Frederick Law Olmsted's "Emerald Necklace" park system and is listed in National Register of Historic Places. Part of the work to construct the deepened channel in the Muddy River is to restore and stabilize the banks after the removal of sediment. The restoration consists of stone protection, turf reinforcement mattress (TRM), and plantings consistent with the historic standards of the park.</p>
<p><br />Range of Magnitude: Between $25M and $35M.</p>
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:<br />a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc...</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via email to Alysha MacDonald, Contract Specialist, at Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil no later than the close of business, 5pm EST on November 24, 2017.</p>

Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond.

If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item managers and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Mr. Peter Murray 252-335-6040 for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration.

<p>Credits shall be assessed against the Contractor in those instances where the circuit during any given month or year that fail to achieve and sustain the minimum acceptance standards stated above.</p>
<p>1.  Definitions:</p>
<p>Circuit Availability Acceptance Level:  Yearly Circuit Availability Acceptance Level is computed by 365 calendar days times 24 (hours per day) times 99.9% acceptance level equals 8,716.20 hours annum.  (365 x 24 = 8760 x 99.9% = 8,733.72).  Monthly Circuit Availability is computed by the calendar days per month times 24 (hours per day) times 99.9% acceptance level (example: 31 x 24 = 744 x 99.7% = 741.76).</p>
<p>Downtime:  That period of time when the circuit becomes non-operational or unusable for communication or transfer of data or failures to meet the minimum acceptance standards. The maximum cumulative Annual downtime that shall be acceptable for corrective or preventative maintenance is 26.28 hours (8760 x .3%). The maximum cumulative Monthly downtime that shall be acceptable for corrective or preventative maintenance shall be .3% of the total available hours for the month (example: 31 x 24 = 744 x .3% = 2.23 hours).</p>
<p>Period of Downtime:  Downtime shall commence at the time first attempt for contact is made by the Government (or its representative) to the Contractor's Point of Contact and shall be annotated on the Remedy Ticket and shall continue until the circuit is returned into Service by the Government.</p>
<p>Downtime Credits:  Monetary value returned to the Government for failure to meet the Circuit availability requirements. Downtime Credits shall be assessed based on cumulative downtime time with the minimum assessment being one hour.  Downtime credit shall be equal to the hourly or daily rate (as applicable) as identified in the schedule in Section B.  There are two (2) situations when circuit Downtime Credits can be accumulated:</p>
<p>1) Below Availability Level,<br /> 2) Extended Downtime.</p>
<p>2.	Credit for Circuit Downtime by Situation</p>
<p>Below Availability Level: If the downtime accumulated for a circuit adds up to 8.76 ( (8760 x 0.1%) cumulative hours or more during any one contract year (365 calendar days) or depending on the number of hours for the month (example 744 x .1%) cumulative hours per month (example: 31 calendar day month) the Contractor shall grant a hourly credit to the Government for each hour of downtime. Each additional one hour increment or portion thereof will be assessed as an additional hour.</p>
<p>Extended Downtime Credit(s):  Cumulative time of more than 18 hours but not greater than 24 hours for any one outage shall be assessed at a daily rate.  Any increment of 24 hours beyond the initial 24 hours of any one outage shall be assessed at the standards for the hourly rate up to 12 hours, however between 12 and 24 hours the credit shall be assessed at the daily rate.</p>
<p>3.	Exceptions to Cumulating of Downtime</p>
<p>Cumulating of circuit downtime shall include all unscheduled downtime deemed to be the responsibility of the Contractor, with the following exceptions:</p>
<p>a.  When the failure to perform arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor or Sub-contractor as defined in the Termination for Default clause in Section I of this contract.</p>
<p>b.   Malfunction of equipment, frequency fading and interference, errors of commission and/or omission by the Contractor or Sub-contractor, and commercial power surges or failures are considered to be normal hazards of the industry and therefore do not qualify as causes beyond the control of the Contractor or Sub-contractor.  The Contractor shall be charged with credits for all reported outages determined "no trouble found" or "came clear while testing" but which exceed 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer shall make final determination as to whether downtime is the responsibility of the Contractor.  If requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide documentation to support claims of excusable downtime.  For downtime determined to be the Contractor's responsibility, the Contracting Officer may elect to assess a credit for each instance of non-performance.</p>
<p>4.	Payment Reduction for Downtime Credits</p>
<p>When Circuit Downtime credit(s) is owed to the Government, the total number of creditable hours shall be accumulated for the month and will be deducted from the payment due the Contractor in the month they accrued.</p>
<p>5.	Trouble Escalation Procedure</p>
<p>a.   The Government shall refer the problem to the carrier after performing tests as prescribed in the Trouble Analysis procedure.  Obtain the name of the carrier test person and a carrier ticket number; record this information on the Government's Remedy Ticket.</p>
<p>b.   After the trouble has been referred to the carrier for two (2) hours, recall the carrier for an update on the current trouble.  Record the carrier's response, the name of the individual you talked with, and the carrier ticket number on the Remedy Ticket.</p>
<p>c.   After the trouble has been referred to the carrier for four (4) hours, recall the carrier for an update on the current trouble.

<p>(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and no other written solicitation will be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ #70FBR218Q00000001 and is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561720, Janitorial Services.
<p>This effort is solicited as a local area set-aside in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford and Local Community Recovery Act of 2006 under NAICS code 561720-Janitorial Services.

This effort will be restricted to potential offerors doing business in the area affected by hurricane Maria and as declared by Presidential Disaster Declaration DR-4339-PR. Attachment #2 to this RFQ identifies the declaration areas. This effort is also being conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement:<br />The Government's intent is to issue a multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill the requirement for janitorial services at multiple FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers. The required period of performance for these services consists of a three month base period of performance with three (3), three (3) month option periods for a total estimated period of performance of 12 months. The ceiling price for any subsequent blanket purchase agreement is $500,000.00. Contractors shall furnish janitorial services if and when requested by the Contracting Officer during the specified period of performance and within the ceiling limits established. The Government will be obligated only to the extent of authorized call orders issued under the BPA. Individual call orders shall not exceed $250,000.00. A list of individuals authorized to make purchases under the BPA shall be furnished to the contractor by the Contracting Officer. Due to the uncertainty of specific locations across the island where disaster recovery centers (DRC) will be established at the time of solicitation, the agency will issue requests for quotes to BPA schedule holders under competitive procedures with the intent to establish call orders for services at designated locations if and when DRCs are established. The Government reserves the right to award multiple BPAs or award a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) from responses received to this solicitation.

<DESC>Senior Malaria Advisor - Luanda, Angola
<p>Under the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), USAID/Angola partners with the Angolan Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve the health status of Angolans through improvements to the quality of service delivery and health systems strengthening activities.</p>
<p>The USAID/Angola budget in FY14 totaled approximately $41 million for health activities in malaria, HIV/AIDS, family planning/reproductive health and polio. There is an opportunity to improve synergies among USAID-funded interventions and develop and implement robust integrated health services delivery and health systems strengthening programs.</p>
<p>To expand access to health services and address systemic issues, USAID's program addresses issues related to human resource management, health finance, commodity procurement and distribution and integrated delivery of high quality services in targeted health facilities. USAID also works with corporations to expand and improve their workplace health programs and with civil society organizations involved in health care to improve their technical and management skills.</p>
<p>USAID partners with the MOH to improve their ability to improve the well-being of Angolans through the delivery of better quality, more reliable health services. Technical assistance focuses on areas such as pharmaceutical logistics, improved human resources and supervisory systems, data management related to program planning, monitoring and budgeting. To increase transparency and responsiveness to local needs, the program also fosters improved communications and relationships between local health staff and the communities they serve. As such, USAID is working with the MOH to develop systems at the national level that are informed by inputs from targeted provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against malaria in Angola, and data from the 2011 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) show an almost 40% decline in parasitemia among children under five years of age from the 2006/7 MIS (from 21% to 13.5%). According to the 2011 MIS, the mortality rate for children under five years of age has fallen by 23% over the last five years, and it is currently estimated at 91 deaths per 1,000 live births.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, malaria continues to be a major health problem and is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in Angola. Malaria accounts for 35% of curative care demand, 35% of mortality in children, 40% of pre-natal mortality, 25% of maternal morbidity, and causes 60% of hospital admissions in children under five years of age and 10% of admissions of pregnant women (Plan National de D&eacute;veloppement Sanitaire (PNDS) 2013, annex 4). Furthermore, malaria is a leading cause of low birth weight, and anemia due to malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Angola was selected as one of three countries to receive funding during the first year of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and has been implementing a significant malaria program for multiple years. The objective of this initiative is to assist African countries, in collaboration with other partners, to rapidly scale up coverage of vulnerable groups with four highly effective interventions: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria in pregnancy, insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), and indoor spraying with residual insecticides (IRS).</p>

REFERENCE NUMBER: N65236-16-R-0005
Space and Naval Warfare System Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic has a requirement to provide program management, engineering, technical documentation, and integrated logistics support services relating to E3.  The technical services provided under this requirement will support overall analytical and technical products to include engineering and technical analysis for C4ISR E3 programs and systems. Testing efforts within the scope of this requirement necessitate the application of extensive knowledge of many types of specialized test equipment, an intimate understanding of data reduction equipment, and the use of intensive analytical skills to develop reports that provide recommendations to protect systems and equipment from degraded performance due to electromagnetic source emissions. This work will support Goal 4 objectives of the "The Navy's Information Dominance Roadmap for Electromagnetic Spectrum Usage (EMSU), and the Electromagnetic Environmental Effect and Spectrum Management (SM) Navy Training System Plan (NTSP) efforts in providing vital Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) support to the warfighter.
The support services shall include, but are not limited to the following areas:
a. Engineering testing includes Test and Evaluation (T&E) efforts supporting the TEMPEST Program and Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) Inspections and Certifications.
b. Environmental T&E efforts will include shock/vibration, altitude, salt fog, and temperature/humidity testing.
c. T&E efforts require site surveys at physical locations, as well as modeling and simulation of sites and equipment sets.
This is a pre-solicitation notice, and the Government anticipates that a formal solicitation will be issued in July 2017 under full and open competition. The Government anticipates award of a single-award, firm-fixed price (FFP), indefinitely delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), performance based contract. The period of performance includes a base year and four one-year option periods. The NAICS code for this effort is 541330, and size standard is $38.5 Million. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. This pre- solicitation notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.

Please submit all questions and inquiries in writing to Kristen Adams, Contract Specialist, at Kristen.adams@navy.mil .

The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

<p>An overall technical rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating, in any factor, results in the overall technical proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE." An overall technical rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a quotation ineligible for award.</p>

All quotations submitted with equivalent product shall be IAW 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal specified criteria and quotations shall provide a matrix that directly points back to all MEC's. It is the Contractors Responsibility to provide enough information to show how their "Or Equal" product meets the required MEC's and is comparable to the requested Brand.</p>
<p>Each of the evaluation factors will be rated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical <br />The degree to which the offeror's quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide the requested brand name items that meet the salient characteristics described in the SOW attachment and can meet the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>The offeror's price quotes will be evaluated to determine the price is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209 and FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />52.246-17 WARRANTY OF SUPPLIES OF A NONCOMPLEX NATURE (JUN 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause --</p>
<p>Acceptance means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Supplies means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include ``data.''</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that for 45 days --</p>
<p>(i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material or workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the preparation for, and method of, shipment of such supplies will conform with the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in transit shall be borne by the Contractor. However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.</p>
<p>(3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.</p>
<p>(4) All implied warranties of merchantability and "fitness for a particular purpose" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Remedies available to the Government.</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect.</p>
<p>(2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting Officer may either--</p>
<p>(i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or</p>
<p>(ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>(3) (i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by sampling procedures, conformance of suppliers or components subject to warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--</p>
<p>(A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;</p>
<p>(B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;</p>
<p>(C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and</p>
<p>(D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.</p>
<p>(ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:</p>
<p>(A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any group of supplies.</p>
<p>(B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies to the Contractor for correction or replacement.</p>
<p>(C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations designated by the Government within the contiguous United States and to correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement.</p>
<p>(4) (i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby if the Contractor--</p>
<p>(A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies within the time established for their return; or</p>
<p>(B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.</p>
<p>(ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract price. In addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable manner. The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for excess costs incurred or to be incurred.</p>
<p>(5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of this contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................ Computer, Desktop with 20 EA ............ ...........<br />CPU, Monitor, Keyboard<br />and Mouse.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Alternative line-item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit Price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................ Computer, Desktop with 20 EA ............ ...........<br />CPU, Keyboard and Mouse.<br />0002............................ Monitor................. 20 EA ............ ...........<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals&#8208;&#8208;<br />[_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />[_] Have, [_] have not, within a three&#8208;year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />[_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />[_] Have, [_] have not, within a three&#8208;year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />Examples.<br />The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.<br />&sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.<br />Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.<br />&sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The Contracting Officer listed in the contract will provide the Contractor with a copy of all rating worksheets that are other than green.<br />At the end of the performance period, the COR will be asked to complete a Quality Performance Review to document the quality performance rating. This will be submitted to the Contracting Officer. If there are any ratings other than green a copy will be furnished to the contractor. <br />The COR may submit a Quality Assurance Worksheet at anytime and as often as necessary to document quality levels. If Contractor response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the appropriate Contractor representative to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency.</p>

<DESC><p>Title: Multi-Platform Sustainment Engineering Advisory and Assistance Services/GSA OASIS</p>
<p>Classification Code:<br />R - Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541330 Engineering Services, Exception A, Engineering for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons</p>
<p>Estimated Award Date: Jan 2018</p>
<p>Period of Performance: One year basic and four one-year option periods</p>
<p>Description: <br />The United States Air Force intends to issue a solicitation for proposals for an upcoming procurement in support of Multi-Platform Sustainment Engineering Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS). This requirement synopsis is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and is released solely for information purposes.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide multi-platform sustainment engineering Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), 848 Supply Chain Management Group (SCMG), 423 Supply Chain Management Squadron (SCMS), located on Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB), OK, and the Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC) production shops, located on Hill Air Force Base (HAFB), Ogden, UT.</p>
<p>Services shall be accomplished at OO-ALC, HAFB, UT. No travel to TAFB, OK, is required. The Government will provide space for one (1) full-time Contractor employee (Reference PWS paragraph 3.2.1.1, Shared Work Center Space). The Contractor employee must be a United States (US) citizen.</p>
<p>848 SCMG engineering has been delegated certain Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) authority. In order to execute the authority vested in the 848 SCMG, the Government requires on-site sustainment engineering support within the production shops at OO-ALC, HAFB, UT.</p>
<p>The health of the spares supply chain is at risk resulting in significant delays in obtaining quality parts. The ability to repair Government items is becoming increasingly complex due to the divergence commonality within the mission design series of parts. As a result, product definition has deteriorated to the point that engineering assistance is often required before repair of spares can take place. This is due to many factors, such as configuration drift of parts and aircraft over time, incomplete technical data, obsolescence of original materials and manufacturing processes, tooling that is either lost, in poor condition, or inappropriate for 21st century use, and a diminished supplier base.</p>
<p>Sustainment engineering efforts are required on items repaired by OO-ALC, and issues affecting structures, avionics, accessories, ground support, and commodity items managed by the 848 SCMG. These commodity items are used on A-10, B-1, B-2, B-52, C-17, C-130, E-3, F-15, F-16, KC-135, and T-38 weapon systems. Engineering tasks shall include analyzing design data, resolving Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), developing fabrication/repair procedures, developing fabrication/repair fixtures and tooling, evaluating damage, evaluating repairs, system integration, and developing technical order source data.</p>
<p>Personnel Qualifications. The Contractor shall ensure the proposed Contractor employee, and any future replacement Contractor employee, if applicable, meets the following knowledge, experience, education, and additional requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of a bachelor's degree in Engineering is required (preferably Mechanical)</p>
<p>&bull; Strong oral and written communication skills are required for daily interaction with multiple Government employees</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of ten (10) years' of senior mechanical engineering experience related to the requirements as defined below in PWS paragraph 1.15.2</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with manufacturing, re-manufacturing or new manufacturing operations</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with developing fabrication/repair procedures, fixtures and tooling</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with the special processes of heat treating, plating, processes and procedures, aerospace finishing, organic coating removal processes and welding</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with evaluating damage, evaluating repairs, and system integration</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with Material Review Boards (MRB) activities, to include defect evaluation and repair procedure development</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with Technical Order (TO) processes and reviews to include developing technical order source data</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) processes and procedures, to include fluorescent penetrant and florescent magnetic particle processes</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor employee shall have a valid driver's license at all times in order to perform services.</p>
<p>The following knowledge and experience is preferred:</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with special processes, such as Media Blasting, Lapping, Cold Spray, Shot Peening, Hard Chrome replacement coatings, and Hydraulic, Pneumatic and Electrical test stands</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY - This Request for Information (RFI) notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FBO.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Center - New Jersey at Picatinny Arsenal, in support of the Project Manager Soldier Weapons, is seeking information on sources capable of manufacturing the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) that provides the capability to remotely aim and fire a suite of crew served weapons. The CROWS is sought for immediate production, fielding and sustainment. The system shall be capable of mounting on a variety of existing and future combat platforms. The system shall consist of a remotely operated and fully stabilized weapon station that can mount and operate a variety of crew served weapons including, at a minimum, the Mk19 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, Mk47 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, M2HB 50 cal Machine Gun, M240 7.62mm Machine Gun and the M249 5.56mm Squad Automatic Weapon. The weapon station shall be controlled via a remote display and control grip allowing the operator to slew and point the system in order to view and engage threats in day and night conditions while stationary or on the move. Systems shall have robust safety checks and diagnostics built in to assure system safety and must meet U.S. military operational safety requirements. The weapon system shall have the ability to accommodate platform specific traverse and firing inhibits for platform unique characteristics. The weight, power and space claim of the system will be limited to accommodate platform integration of current and emerging requirements. <br /><br /><br />SPECIFICATION: <br />This RFI is intended to inform the Government on the current status of industry sources, business practices, technical capacity, and operational capability. In support of CROWS manufacturing, sources shall be capable of managing an extensive supplier base to effectively and efficiently provide a flexible production capability that can easily adapt to changes in production rates and configurations. It is anticipated that production rates can vary from 0-50 CROWS/month (may be a combination of new systems and overhauling existing CROWS), depending on the requirements and resources available. In addition to new production, sources shall have the ability to overhaul previously fielded CROWS to include cleaning, repair of broken components, replacement of lost parts, and final inspection. It is expected that sustainment activities for new and existing systems may require some or all of the following: depot repair facility, Field Service Representatives, spare parts, obsolescence management and special tools. Engineering support shall be available, as required, for product improvements, root cause analysis, production support and other activities normally expected for a program of this magnitude. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, the Government would provide the source(s) with a combination of a technical data package, interface control documents, performance specifications (system and selected parts) and other available documentation which will describe the requirements and current CROWS designs. The CROWS has several components that are no longer available on the commercial market. An engineering effort to identify replacement components or a redesign of the electronic cards will be required. Some or all of this data may be export controlled which may require appropriate approvals to allow Contractors and their suppliers to share part or all of the information required to perform their tasks. At a minimum, field replaceable parts shall be backward compatible to currently fielded CROWS. Software management of CROWS will be the responsibility of the US Government and will not be shared with sources other than the "executable code" required to operate the CROWS. Any software changes required due to the selection of replacement components or a redesign of the electronic cards will need to be made in conjunction with the Government Software team. The need and demand for such systems has been significant in the past several years and has the potential to continue in the future. The Government is interested in assessing the engineering and production capability of potential firms/vendors to meet a varying production rate of 0-50/month for systems as well as the necessary engineering services required to support the same.

<DESC><p>DLA Energy, in conjunction with the United States Army, is amending Solicitation No. SPE600-15-R-0807 to extend the proposal due date for the Thermal Production and Distribution System (NAICS 221330) requirement. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposals will be accepted for the Thermal Production and Distribution System requirement only. The due date for proposals for the Electric and Natural Gas systems has passed, and no proposals will be accepted for those systems.<br /></span><br />A copy of the amendment will be available on or after September 29, 2017, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).</p>
<p>Utilities Privatization (UP) is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity, for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacements. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. UP will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the Thermal Production and Distribution System. The new owner shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Any resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility system owner's responsibility. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.</p>
<p>Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right to Access or an Easement as a reference to the resultant contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Sources Sought Notices for this requirement were previously publicized under solicitation number SPE600-15-R-0807 on January 27, 2015 and March 9, 2016. Both Sources Sought Notices have closed and market research is complete. This requirement will be unrestricted. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.</p>
<p>Other-than-small businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources may contact Carly Dubernas at carly.dubernas@dla.mil, Ryan Spahr at ryan.spahr@dla.mil, or James Thompson at james.j.thompson@dla.mil to be added to our offeror mailing list.</p>
<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after September 29, 2017, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Please note that FBO has updated their security requirements, which requires that previously registered users must reactivate their account. See www.fbo.gov for more information.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:<br />a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at<br />http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf.<br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.<br /><br />********************************************************************<br />U.S. Army Garrison West Point will be available for additional site visits on 27-30 November and 4-7 December, 2017.

DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<DESC>Request for Proposals #140P8318R0001 is to replace windows, skylights, and exterior doors at the North Cascade Visitor Center.  This building was built in 1991 and is 11,930 square feet. The glass elements to be replaced are original. The building will be closed to the public during construction although NPS employees may work on-site intermittently. Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals, which will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately October 23, 2017.
PROJECT LOCATION: The North Cascades Visitor Center is located in Newhalem, WA, approximately 65 miles east of Sedro-Woolley WA within Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Maps and information are posted at www.nps.gov/NOCA.
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held at 11:00 am on November 1, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation. Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory). Requests for individual hosted site visits will not be honored; however, contractors may view the building's exterior and site individually any time. The visitor center is open to the public October 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 28, 2017, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, and then closes until early May, 2018. 
TARGET WORK DATES: The period of performance will be 60 days after commencing on-site work and substantial completion must occur by May 4, 2018. The Notice to Proceed will likely be issued in January and the Contractor may select their on-site starting date. We anticipate that the work will occur in March and April, 2018, due to winter weather conditions at the site.
DETAILS: This is a best value negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION/BACGROUND

The mission of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) is to enable readiness and health for Sailors, Marines and their families. In support of this, an underlying and fundamental need for a culture of health and safety is essential to not only prepare but also strengthen and build the resilience of a ready fighting force.

ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) and Navy implementing memorandum dated May 28, 2010 direct implementation of HSPD-12.
  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  
Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contract health care workers working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a Common Access Card.

ACCESS TO DOD SYSTEMS
In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractors who require access to DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III.  This clause applies to contractors who require IT-II privileged access  to a DoN or  DoD unclassified computer/network; the IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI) .
  All contract worker positions under this contract require access to Privacy Act protected information and are therefore categorized as no lower than IT-II.  

PROCEDURES
Obtain a favorable background check determination; each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks.  Each contractor employee is required to complete:

	SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)
	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
	Original Signed Release Statements

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.
  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access Privacy Act information on a DoD unclassified computer/network,   the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.
When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.
  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.
  
The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Command Security Manager.  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.
  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness and accuracy prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.    An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF 86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.  If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).
  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract. 
The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.   Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a eligibility determination.  

DENIAL OF ACCESS
The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees.
 The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

INTERIM ACCESS
The Navy Commands Security Manager may authorize issuance of a CAC card and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the SF-86 questionnaire and advance fingerprint results.  When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees working on the contract under interim access shall be removed immediately and will no longer be authorized to work on the contract.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">NAICS Code: 811219 Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-12-003, as described below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The US Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) has installed one and hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. Operators at the stations perform basic operations, primarily starting and stopping the air sampler to change filters. At most locations, a mechanical or instrument technician is not available to correct problems. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During normal operations, filters are changed by a local operator and mailed to EPA laboratory for analysis. During sample collection, the monitoring stations continuously monitor the filter for accumulation of radioactive material. The radiation measurements are stored by the monitoring station and transmitted, both automatically and on demand, via communications systems that are an integral pat of the monitoring station, to the EPA&rsquo;s National Analytical Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL), in Montgomery, Alabama. Whenever deemed necessary, NAREL remotely connects with one or more monitoring stations to initiate transfer of additional data and/or to modify operation parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent contractor provides the on-site maintenance and repair of these monitors. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The current contract, EP-D-12-003, period of performance was extended for six months from December 11, 2016 to June 11, 2017 via FAR Clause 52.217-8-Option to Extend Services. The current contract was then extended for an additional five months from June 11, 2017 to November 11, 2017 via FAR Clause 6.302-2-Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and two one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of November 11, 2017 of contract EP-D-12-003. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional three months to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by ORIA in order to maintain the one hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at the outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This notice will be posted for 5 days. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-003, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (</span><a href="mailto:Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">) within <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">5 days</strong> from the date of this notice.</span></p>

<DESC>PREAMBLE
<p>This preamble is provided for informational purposes only to assist offerors with understanding the unique features of this solicitation. It is not intended to address all of the requirements of the solicitation. In the event of discrepancies between the contents of this preamble and the solicitation, provisions within the solicitation will prevail.</p>
<p>Overview. This solicitation is for the qualifications phase (Phase I) of the design-build of the Postal Square Suite Renovation. The primary objective of this project is to successfully develop the winning design concept in partnership with the selected designer and to renovate the suite.</p>
<p><br />Contract Characteristics and Source Selection Overview. The Government intends to award a design-build, Fixed Price (FFP) contract for this project. The contractor will maximize customer satisfaction by effective management, innovation, and establishment of a cooperative, effective partnership with the Government.</p>
<p>A two-phased, best value design-build selection process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.3 will be utilized for this source selection. This solicitation, Phase I, is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Only those successful offerors from Phase I will be invited to submit proposals in response to the Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP). The purpose of Phase I is to seek qualifications based on relevant and recent past performance as well as the design-build Offeror's approach to the project with respect to the anticipated role of the selected concept designer and its organization structure.</p>
<p>Partnership. The degree of success of this project will depend largely upon the nature of the relationship between the Contractor and the Government. The Government's intent is to work with the Contractor as an integrated team with common goals of improving quality and productivity, and achieving cost savings and other economies and efficiencies across the full spectrum of performance. To the greatest degree possible, the Government intends to adopt commercial practices to accomplish these goals. The Government will provide the Contractor maximum flexibility to determine specific work methods that satisfy the performance based requirements in the contract. The Government expects the Contractor to participate with the Government in continuous improvement activities, and proactively address risks and challenges to project success. The Government also intends to work with the Contractor to devise and implement processes that are appropriate for this design-build project and provide the Government insight into project progress without an undue level of Government oversight.</p>
